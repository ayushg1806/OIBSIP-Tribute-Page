            <p>
                Pandit Chandrashekhar Azad, born on July 23, 1906, in Bhavra village in present-day Alirajpur district
                of Madhya Pradesh, India, was a prominent Indian freedom fighter and revolutionary who played a
                significant role in the Indian independence movement.<br><br>
                Azad was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the non-cooperation movement
                led by Mahatma Gandhi. He became actively involved in revolutionary activities against British rule
                at an early age and joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) founded by Ram Prasad Bismil.<br><br>
                Azad was known for his valour, fearlessness, and commitment to the cause of Indian independence. He
                participated in several acts of defiance against British rule, including the Kakori train robbery in
                1925 and the assassination of J.P. Saunders, a British police officer, in 1928.<br><br>
                One of Azad's most famous acts of resistance was the defiance he showed during the "Alfred Park Incident"
                in Allahabad on February 27, 1931. Surrounded by British police, Azad fought bravely to the end, refusing
                to surrender, and ultimately chose death over capture.<br><br>
                Pandit Chandrashekhar Azad remains a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism in the annals of Indian
                history. His legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to strive for freedom, justice, and equality.
